Hey 👋 I’m Iyed Chebbi — an Embedded Software Engineer from Tunisia with a vibe coder mindset.

I build smart systems where hardware, software, and AI work together. From STM32 ARM Cortex microcontrollers to Embedded Linux on Raspberry Pi, I design robotics and AI automation that actually thinks. I use n8n to turn complex processes into clean, hands-free workflows that just run.

I code with a 2026 futuristic energy — mixing engineering logic with creativity, experimenting with clever AI tricks, and pushing boundaries every day.

Beyond embedded systems, I also craft modern websites and digital experiences. Recently, I built:

🌍 A website for a Romanian home-cleaning startup

🏜️ A website for Elarich Tozeur, a residence based in Tozeur, Tunisia

When I’m not engineering systems, I’m creating cinematic AI videos, gaming to recharge, or thinking about how to make machines smarter.

I don’t just write code — I build systems that communicate, automate, and evolve.
