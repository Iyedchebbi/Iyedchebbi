## Hi there 👋

I’m Iyed Chebbi, an embedded software engineer based in Tunisia.

I work with STM32 ARM Cortex microcontrollers and embedded Linux on Raspberry Pi 🧠🔧.

I design and build robotics and AI automation systems using n8n to turn complex tasks into smooth workflows 🤖⚙️.

I’m in a 2026 coding vibe, where I build clever AI tricks and push creative boundaries 💡💻.

Fun facts: 
-I love gaming 🎮
-I’m a proud FC Barcelona fan 🔵🔴
-and I bike almost everywhere 🚴‍♂️.
